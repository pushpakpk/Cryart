# Task 1: Neural Network Regression with NumPy

## Description
This task implements a simple feedforward neural network from scratch using only NumPy. 
It is trained on a synthetic cubic regression dataset.

## Files
- `model.py`: Neural network layers, activations, and loss
- `train.ipynb`: Data generation, training loop, and visualizations
- `README.md`: This file

## Run Instructions
1. Install dependencies: `pip install numpy matplotlib`
2. Open and run `train.ipynb` in Jupyter
3. Observe:
   - Loss curve over epochs
   - Final predictions vs. true data
